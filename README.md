# BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION - ( SOTA CNN )
This project is about developing a CNN model in PyTorch to classify brain MRI scans and detect tumors. The dataset used for this task is not abundant in quantity and quality, which has been the challenge in reaching optimal performance. 
However, this project provided me with a learning experience , especially since it was my first time working in the fields of Machine Learning (Image Processing).

Throughout the development process, I referred multiple resources to further clarify basic concepts and refine the design of the model. 
At times, I refer to this code and code-logic to troubleshoot and try improve my approach to be sure that the basic foundation is strong making it comfortable to fine tune it further, thus helps me in gaining a better understanding of the underlying logic behind ML models.

Going forward, I intend to continue learning and improving in this field. I will focus on building stronger models and working towards addressing issues such as dataset limitation.
